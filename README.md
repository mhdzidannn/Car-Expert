# Project Description

-	It's like [carlist.my](https://www.carlist.my/) but the mobile app version

-	We did this app as a freelancing work during the quarantine, as well as a stepping stone for me to learn Flutter

-	Took the two of us from March 2020 until August 2020 to finish the project

# App Overview

- This mobile app has 2 types of users:

    ->   Normal Users, those who buys the cars
    ->   Dealers, those who sells cars

# The challenges faced in accomplishing this project


### Problem 1:
Difficulty on doing a meeting and discuss with teammate and client due to quarantine.

Solution: Discord as a medium to collaborating and discussing the project.


### Problem 2:
Having hard time choosing app state management (Redux, Bloc, Provider)

Solution: We spent a lot of time playing and testing around with the different state manager. We decided to choose Provider.


### Problem 3:
No inspiration for the UIUX design. 

Solution: Hired a friend to do the UIUX for us.


### Problem 3:
Did not follow the app mockup entirely.

Explanation: I think it is because we are learning, exploring multitudes of widgets in Flutter.
